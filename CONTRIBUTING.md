## 🔁 Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository (or create a new branch from `main` if you have write access).
2. **Create** your markdown profile in `/portfolio/`.
3. *(Optional)* Add useful resource links in `/resources/`.
4. **Commit** and push your changes to your branch (not directly to `main`).
5. **Open a Pull Request** to `main` with a clear title and description.
6. **Wait for review and approval.** Your PR will be reviewed by a maintainer before merging.

> **Note:** Direct pushes to `main` are disabled. All changes must go through a Pull Request for review and approval.

That’s it! The GitHub Action will auto-update the contributor list in `README.md` based on your file.
